I'm working on a python3 script to download zip files from IEA website. However, i dont know how to clear the pop-up authentication before proceeding to download my zip files. 

The final script only has to do the following:
 1) handle pop-up authentication 
 2) download zip file

login details cant be shared for obvious reason. I will test out the script as soon as it's sent to me.
